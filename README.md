# 🛠️ Python Mini Projects  

This repository contains 5 beginner-friendly Python mini projects I built to practice programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.  

## 📂 Projects Included:
1. 🧮 Calculator  
   A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
   ➡️ *Practice:* functions, user input, conditional statements.  

2. ✅ To-Do List  
   A program to manage daily tasks (add, view, delete tasks).  
   ➡️ *Practice:* lists, loops, file handling (optional).  

3. 🎯 Guess the Number  
   A fun game where the user guesses a random number generated by the computer.  
   ➡️ *Practice:* loops, conditionals, random module.  

4. ⚖️ BMI Calculator  
   Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input (height & weight).  
   ➡️ *Practice:* math operations, input validation.  

5. 🔑 Password Generator  
   Generates a secure random password with letters, digits, and symbols.  
   ➡️ *Practice:* random module, string manipulation.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used:
- Python 3.x  
- Loops & Conditionals  
- Functions  
- Random module  
- File Handling (for To-Do List)

## 🎯 Purpose:
These mini-projects help strengthen Python basics and prepare for more advanced topics like Data Science (NumPy, Pandas) and larger projects.  

## 🚀 Next Steps:
- Add more mini-projects (e.g., Weather App, Currency Converter).  
- Move to NumPy and Pandas for data analysis.
